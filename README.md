## Console Application using C++ OOP
This repository contains a console application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The application showcases the power and flexibility of C++ in creating structured and modular code, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

## Features
### Modular Design:
The application is divided into multiple classes, each representing a specific module or functionality. This modular design helps in isolating changes and makes the code more manageable.
### Encapsulation: 
By using access specifiers (private, protected, public), the application ensures that the internal states of objects are protected from unauthorized access, promoting data integrity.
### Inheritance: 
The application demonstrates inheritance by creating derived classes from base classes, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.
### Polymorphism: 
The use of virtual functions and overriding allows the application to handle different data types and behaviors uniformly.
### Abstraction: 
By focusing on essential qualities rather than specific characteristics, the application simplifies complex systems into manageable interfaces.
## Structure
The project is structured as follows:  
**src/**: Contains all the source code files.  
**include/**: Contains header files for the classes and functions.  
**bin/**: Contains the compiled executable files.  
**docs/**: **Contains documentation files, including user guides and technical documentation.  

## Requirements
A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
CMake (optional, for build automation)
